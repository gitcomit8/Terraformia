# How to Approach the Project

1.  Start with an Idea: Have a clear idea or concept for what you want to build. This could be inspired by something you've used, a problem you've faced, or just a feature you'd like to explore.

2.  User Stories (Light): Write down 3-5 core features as user stories in their simplest form (e.g., "As a user, I can log in" instead of breaking it into more detailed tasks). This will serve as your initial roadmap without feeling overwhelming.

3.  High-Level Project Plan: Create a simple list or timeline with major milestones for your project, e.g.:
  
    -  Refer to [Project Plan](docs/plan.md)

4.  Iterative Development: Work on your project in small increments, focusing on one feature or task at a time. This approach lets you:

    -   Learn new skills as needed while working on specific features.
    -   Gather feedback (even if it's just from yourself) and adjust plans accordingly.
    -   Avoid feeling overwhelmed by the scope of the entire project.
5.  Notes and Code Comments: Instead of creating comprehensive documentation, make a habit of taking notes and leaving comments in your code to:

    -   Explain why you've chosen certain approaches or made specific design decisions.
    -   Document any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
    -   Keep track of what each part of the code does.
6.  Regular Check-ins with Yourself: Set aside some time periodically (e.g., once a week) to review your progress, reflect on what you've learned so far, and plan next steps. This will help keep you motivated and focused.
