# PROJECT TIMELINE

1.  Week 1 - 2 (Planning & Setup):
    -   Define your project scope more specifically based on the features you want to implement, including error handling and documentation.
    -   Set up your development environment with Node.js, npm, Git for version control, and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Initialize a new repository in GitHub (or any other preferred platform) for collaborative work if needed.
2.  Weeks 3-4 (Core CLI Functionality Development):
    -   Create the command-line interface using the commander library to handle user interactions effectively and create basic arguments and options handling as described earlier, including seed input, output directory, site name customization options, etc. Use commands like program.command('generateÂ [options]') for generating websites based on seeds.
3.  Weeks 5-6 (Developing Procedural Site Generator):
    -   Implement the design and logic of your seed-based algorithm using JavaScript (Node.js) to generate a procedurally unique website for each inputted seed value while considering directory structure, file content formatting, randomness based on seeds, and other factors mentioned earlier.
4.  Week 7 (Testing & Quality Assurance):
    -   Conduct extensive testing with various seed inputs to ensure the consistency in generated outputs' quality and accuracy of website generation logic implemented earlier. Identify any bugs or issues found during testing and fix them accordingly.
5.  Additional Features:
    -   Error handling, help commands/documentation are optional features that could be added based on time availability after completing all core functionality requirements as mentioned previously within the three-month timeline you've provided. These enhancements can significantly improve user experience and overall quality of your website generator tool by providing meaningful error messages for easier troubleshooting, reducing user frustration while using incorrect commands or options in CLI interface, etc.,
